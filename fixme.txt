To Deal With Compile Error:
Try to think that RestrictionHandler in fact is a SPI, (which is considerately 
should be used by framework developers, not end-user/application developers). 
So it might be ok to have #getEntityName on it. 

Another things is that please consider to:
- add #getFullPathProperty() to Restriction handler, to used by restriction 
  handler / query builder to get full path (entity + field) properly.
- More over, think to create Property class that will encapsulate field(s) and 
  it's value and hide entity name prefix properly. Example
  PropertyBuilder pb = new PropertyBuilder(Person.class);
  QueryBuilder qb = new JPAQueryBuilder(Person.class);
  qb.select(pb.get("name"), pb.("address"));
  // or
  qb.select($$("name"), $$("address")); 

-------------------------------------------------
new Restriction("field", EQUAL, KEEP) produce "where entity.field is null" 
in case there's no value(s) passed to Restriction. How if we have
new Restriction("field", NOT_EQUAL, KEEP) ? Do we pass the same value as EQUAL,
which is "where entity.field is null" or do we need another semantics?

Re-Design ResultMapper Interface To More Flexible

Seems like ResultMapper is going to wrong direction. Let say we have:

/**
 * Used to display something like:
 * First Previous [1] [2] [3] ... [10] Next Last 
 */
public interface JQueryDataTableResultMapper<E> extends ListResultMapper<E> {
    /** [1] [2] [3] [4] */
    int[] getPagingNumbers();
    
    int getFirstDataIndex();
    int getPreviousDataIndex();
    // etc etc.. 
}

How do we going to tell the Finder implementation that method Finder#find need 
to return JQueryDataTableResultMapper instance instead of ListResultMapper?

A:  Well, this is obvious: By extending the Finder interface.
Q:  But the Finder interface doesn't provide any way to get it's implementation 
    details.
A:  Nah, that is SPI what for. Write SPI that provide any object for the Finder
    interface to build the query.
 
Well, let see.


------------------------------------------------------
Do We Really Need Finder#join(String...fields) method?

Of course! There's a people out there that don't like OSIV/OEMIV Servlet Filter 
and prefer explicit join on their HQL/JPQL.

How If We Add New Cool Feature Like $ (Dollar) Project?

Sure we can. But just make sure the crucial functional was satisfied.
